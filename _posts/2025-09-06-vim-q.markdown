This article discusses how to use Visual Selection in Vim when working with WSL.

In Windows Terminal, Ctrl-V is assigned to paste text. However, in Vim, Ctrl-V is a critical shortcut for blockwise Visual selection.

According to the Vim documentation, this causes a conflict:

> ```
                       *CTRL-V-alternative* *CTRL-Q*
Since CTRL-V is used to paste, you can't use it to start a blockwise Visual
selection.  You can use CTRL-Q instead.  You can also use CTRL-Q in Insert
mode and Command-line mode to get the old meaning of CTRL-V.  But CTRL-Q
doesn't work for terminals when it's used for control flow.
```

[Vim documentation: gui_w32](https://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/gui_w32.html#CTRL-V-alternative)


To resolve this, I added the following line to my `vimrc`:

```vim
noremap <C-Q> <C-V>
```
